My name is Hyunwon Chung, and I’m currently a master’s student at the University of Michigan. I’m entering my PhD this fall at UofM under the guidance of Professor David Blaauw and Hun-Seok Kim.</p> <p>My research is primarily focused on reconfigurable architectures, with a keen interest in their applications across diverse fields such as communication systems and machine learning. At the heart of my current research is the exploration and development of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRA)</code>. My aim is to design systems that are not only ultra-low in power consumption but also excel in performance.</p> <p>This area of study is particularly fascinating to me as it presents a unique blend of challenges and opportunities. By harnessing the flexibility of CGRAs, I aspire to contribute to the development of more efficient, adaptable, and powerful computing systems. This research has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach both hardware design and computational tasks in various high-tech domains.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too.
