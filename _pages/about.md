Hello! My name is Hyunwon Chung, and I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan. I am supervised by Professors David Blaauw and Hun-Seok Kim.

My research is primarily focused on reconfigurable architectures, with a interest in their applications across diverse fields such as communication systems and machine learning. My current work involves exploring and developing `dataflow architectures` on reconfigurable hardware to achieve high performance while maintaining efficient resource utilization.

This area of study is particularly fascinating to me, especially in applications with significant irregularity and a high demand for independent parallel tasks. By leveraging the flexibility of hardware, my goal is to develop architectures that efficiently exploit dataflow to minimize hardware overhead while achieving high throughput. This research has the potential to transform the way we design hardware and execute computational tasks across various domains.
